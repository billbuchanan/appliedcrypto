# Lab 1: Cipher Fundamentals

Objective: The key objective of this lab is to be introduced to some of the fundamental principles involved in cryptography, including the usage of Base-64, hexadecimal, the modulus operator some basic operators (such as AND, OR, X-OR, Rotate Right and Rotate Left), and prime numbers. This lab also involves cracking puzzles, and which have been added to get you to think about the methods involved in cipher cracking. You can undertake the additional challenges if you want to further develop your cryptography skills.

## Introduction
Note: Most of the examples are in Python 3. If there are Python 2 examples, remember and put parenthesis around the print statement string, such as print (hex(val)).

### A.1	Is prime?

Test for the following prime numbers:
91: [Yes] [No]	

421: [Yes] [No]

1449: [Yes] [No]


### A.2	gcd

Using: [here](https://asecuritysite.com/principles_pub/gcd)

Determine the GCD for the following:
88, 46:

105, 35: 

### A.3 Base-64 convertor 

Using: [here](http://asecuritysite.com/coding/ascii)

Determine the Base 64 and Hex values for the following strings:

hello:

HELLO:


### A.4	Base-64 convertor 

Using: [here](http://asecuritysite.com/coding/ascii)

Determine the following ASCII strings for these encoded formats:

```
bGxveWRz
6E6170696572
01000001 01101110 01101011 01101100 01100101 00110001 00110010 00110011
```

### A.5	The mod operator
Using Python, what is the result of 53,431 (mod 453)?

In Python, this is: 

```python
print (53431 % 453)
```


### A.6	Bitwise operations
Using Python, what is the results of the following:

```python
print (0x43 | 0x21)
print (0x43 & 0x21)
print (0x43 ^ 0x21)
```

In this case, "|" does a bitwise OR, "&" does a bitwise AND, and "^" does a bitwise X-OR. Using a pen and paper, prove that these results are correct.	Results:


### A.7	Hex, Oct, Char and Binary
Using Python, what is the hex, octal, character, and binary equivalents of the value of 93:

```python
val1=93
print ("Dec:\t",val1)
print ("Bin:\t",bin(val1))
print ("Hex:\t",hex(val1))
print ("Oct:\t",oct(val1))
print ("Char:\t",chr(val1))
```

Results:

### A.8	Node.js
JavaScript is often used in cryptography. Using node.js, repeat A.7.

```node
val=93
console.log(val.toString(2))
console.log(val.toString(16))
console.log(val.toString(8))
console.log(String.fromCharCode(val))
```

This program will use node.js. Create a file named a_08.js and then run with:

```
node a_08.js
```

Results:


### A.9	Base64

```python
import base64
str='crypto'
print (base64.b64encode(str.encode()))
```

Result:


### A.10 Base64
If we use a string of "crypto1", what do you observe from the Base64 conversion compared to the result in the previous question (A.9)?	
Observation:

Using Python, using a decimal value of 41, determine the result of a shift left by one bit, a shift left by two bits, a right shift by one bit, and a right shift by two bits:

Web link (Bit shift): [here](https://asecuritysite.com/comms/shift)

Decimal form:     41

Shift left (1):	

Shift left (2):	

Shift right(1):	

Shift right(2):

Why would a shift left or shift right operator not be used on its own in cryptography?


### A.12 Factors
In several cases in cryptography, we try and factorize a value into its factors. An example is 15, and which has factors of 5 and 3. Using the Python program defined in the following link, determine the factors of 432:

Web link (Factorization): [here](https://asecuritysite.com/primes/factors)

Think of two extremely large values and determine their factors. 


### A.13 Compression
Another format we can use for our data is compression, and we can do the compression before or after the encryption process. One of the most popular methods is gzip compress, and which uses the LZ method to reduce the number of bits used. For this we will use node.js. Create a file named a_13.js and  determine what the following Base64 conversions are when they are uncompressed (Hint: they are cities of the World):

Web link (Compression): [here](https://asecuritysite.com/encryption/gzip)

Take a string of “abc” and compress it, and now keep building up the string with the same sequence (such as “abcabc…”). What do you observe from the length of the compression string if you use a random characters of the same length as an input:
	
```python
eJzzyc9Lyc8DAAgpAms=
eJxzSi3KycwDAAfXAl0=
eJzzSy1XiMwvygYADKUC8A==
```

## B	GCD
GCD is known as the greatest common divisor, or greatest common factor (gcf), and is the largest positive integer that divides into two numbers without a remain-der. For example, the GCD of 9 and 15 is 3. It is used many encryption algorithms, and a sample algorithm to determine the GCD of two values (a and b) is given on:

Web link (GCD):	[here](https://asecuritysite.com/principles_pub/gcd)

### B.1	Write a Python program to determine the GCD for the following:

4105 and 10: 

4539 and 6:

### B.2	Two numbers are co-prime if they do not share co-factors, apart from 1, which is gcd(a,b)=1.

Determine if the following values are co-prime:

5435 and 634: Yes/No

## C	Modulus and Exponentiation
The mod operator results in the remainder of an integer divide. For example, 31 divided by 8 is 3 remainder 7, thus 31 mod 8 equals 7. Often in cryptography the mod operation uses a prime number, such as:

Result = value<sup>x</sup> mod (prime number)

For example, if we have a prime number of 269, and a value of 8 with an x value of 5, the result of this operation will be:

Result = 85 mod 269 = 219

With prime numbers, if we know the result, it is difficult to find the value of x even though we have the other values, as many values of x can produce the same result. It is this feature which makes it difficult to determine a secret value (in this case the secret is x).

Exponentiation ciphers use a form of:

C = M<sup>e</sup> mod p

to encrypt and decrypt a message (M) using a key of e and a prime number p. 

### C.1	What is the result of the following:


8<sup>13</sup> mod 271:

12<sup>23</sup> mod 973:


### C.2	Implement a Python program which will determine the result of:

M<sup>e</sup> mod p

The program should check that p is a prime number.Is the  result of 8<sup>5</sup> mod 269 equal to 219?

Yes/No


### C.3	Proving
Now prove the following:

* message = 5, e=5, p = 53. Ans: 51
* message = 4, e=11, p = 79. Ans: 36
* message = 101, e=7, p = 293. Ans: 176

An outline of the Python 2.7 code is:

```python
message = input('Enter message value: ')
e =  input('Enter exponent: ') 
p = input('Enter prime ')

cipher = (int(message) ** int(e)) % int(p)
print (f"Result is: {cipher}")	
```

# AWS Setup
In future labs, we will investigation Cloud-based encryption and security. For this we will be using AWS KMS (Key Management System) and AWS HSM (Hardware Security Module). We will be using the AWS command line console, Python and the AWS Management Console. If you have time, setup a Linux instance (instead of AWS Linux your might want to install Ubuntu). The lab is [here](https://github.com/billbuchanan/appliedcrypto/blob/main/unit01_cipher_fundamentals/lab/aws/aws_linux.pdf). If you want, you can use the AWS instance for future labs instead of the one in vSoC2.

# Advanced Lab
If you are looking to do extra exercises, this section provides some additional challenges.
## D	Simple prime number test
A prime number is a value which only has factors of 1 and itself. Prime numbers are used fairly extensively in cryptography, as computers struggle to factorize them when they are multiplied together.  The simplest test for a prime number is to divide the value from all the integers from 2 to the value divided by 2. If any of the results leaves no remainder, the value is a prime, otherwise it is composite. We can obviously improve on this by getting rid of even numbers which are greater than 2, and also that the highest value to be tested is the square root of the value. 

So, if n = 37, then our maximum value will be  , which, when rounded down is 6. So, we can try: 2, 3, and 5, of which of none of these divide exactly into 37, so it is a prime number. Now let’s try 55, we will then be 2, 3, 5 and 7. In this case 5 does divide exactly in 55, so the value is not prime.

Another improvement we can make is that prime numbers (apart from 2 and 3) fit into the equation of:

6k ± 1

where k=0 gives 0 and 1, k=1 gives 5 and 7, k=2 gives 11 and 13, k=3 gives 17 and 19, and so on. Thus we can test if we can divide by 2 and then by 3, and then check all the numbers of 6k ± 1 up to X.

Web link (Prime Numbers):	http://asecuritysite.com/encryption/isprime

### D.1	Using the equation of 6k ± 1. Determine the prime numbers up to 100:
Prime numbers:


### D.2	Implement a Python program which will calculate the prime numbers up to 1000:
	Define the highest prime number generated:


A prime sieve creates all the prime numbers up to a given limit. It progressively removes composite numbers until it only has prime numbers left, and it is the most efficient way to generate a range of prime numbers. The following provides a fast method to determine the prime numbers up to a give value (test):

```python
import sys

test=1000

if (len(sys.argv)>1):
	test=int(sys.argv[1])

def sieve_for_primes_to(n):
    size = n//2
    sieve = [1]*size
    limit = int(n**0.5)
    for i in range(1,limit):
        if sieve[i]:
            val = 2*i+1
            tmp = ((size-1) - i)//val 
            sieve[i+val::val] = [0]*tmp
    return [2] + [i*2+1 for i, v in enumerate(sieve) if v and i>0]
 
print (sieve_for_primes_to(test))
```


### D.3	Implement the Python code given above and determine the highest prime number possible in the following ranges:
	Up to 100:

Up to 1,000:

Up to 5,000:

Up to 10,000:


The Miller-Rabin Test for Primes is an efficient method in testing for a prime number. Access the following page and download the Python script. 

Web link (Miller-Radin):	http://asecuritysite.com/primes/rabin

Using this determine the following:


### D.4	Prime numbers
Which of the following numbers are prime numbers:
Is 5 prime? Yes/No

Is 7919 prime? Yes/No

Is 858,599,509 prime? Yes/No

Is 982,451,653 prime? Yes/No

Is 982,451,652 prime? Yes/No



## E	Random numbers
Within cryptography random numbers are used to generate things like encryption keys. If the generation of these keys could be predicted in some way, it may be possible to guess it. The two main types of random number generators are:

* Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs).  Repeats after a given time.  Fast. They are also deterministic and periodic, so that the random number generation will eventually repeat.
* True Random Number Generators (TRNGs). This method is a true random number such as for keystroke analysis.  It is generally slow but is non-deterministic and aperiodic.

Normally simulation and modelling use PRNG, so that the values generated can be repeated each time, while cryptography, lotteries, gambling and games use TRNG, as each value which is selected at random should not repeat or be predictable. In the generation of encryption keys for public key encryption, a user is typically asked to generate some random activity with their mouse pointer. The random number is then generated on this activity.

Computer programs often struggle to generate TRNG, and hardware generators are sometimes used. One method is to generate a random number based on low-level, statistically random "noise" signals. This includes things like thermal noise, and a photoelectric effect.

Web link (Random number):	[here](http://asecuritysite.com/random/random)

One method of creating a simple random number generator is to use a sequence generator of the form (Linear Congruential Random Numbers):

	 

Where a, c and m are integers, and where X0 is the seed value of the series.

If we take the values of a=21, X0=35, c=31 and m=100 we get a series of:

```
66 17 88 79 90 21 72 43 34 45 76 27 98 89 0 31 82 53
```

Using this example, we get:
```
(21×35+31) mod 100 gives 66
(21×66+31) mod 100 gives 17
(21×17+31) mod 100 gives 88
```

### E.1	
Implement the Python code given above.

Using: a=21, seed=35, c=31, and m=100, prove that the sequence gives 66 17 88 79 90

Yes/No

a=22, seed=35, c=31, and m=100.

a=954,365,343, seed=436,241, c=55,119,927, and m=1,000,000.

First four numbers of sequence?


### E.4

a=2,175,143, seed=3553, c=10,653, and m=1,000,000.
