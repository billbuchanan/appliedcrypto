## Sample Exam Questions

The following are sample questions:

* Bitcoin technology has a major problem with its proof-of-work method of gaining a consensus. What are the current drawbacks?
* How does Ethereum overcome the problems of the proof-of-work method?
* How does the payment of gas focus developers to create efficient coding?
* Alice says that her Bitcoin ID address uses Base-64. Is this the case? If not, what format does it use?
* Trent says that no way that anyone can track his transactions on Bitcoin. Is this true? If not, explain your argument.
* What evidence does a miner have to give to show it has found the required hash for a block?
* How many bits does a Bitcoin ID have? Outline the process of generating the ID.
* Many ransomware systems use bitcoins for payments. You have been asked by an incident response team to report on the payments that resulted from the Wannacry ransomware infection. For the first part of your investigation, report on the activity on the Bitcoin addresses of 13AM4VW2dhxYgXeQepoHkHSQuy6NgaEb94, 12t9YDPgwueZ9NyMgw519p7AA8isjr6SMw and 115p7UMMngoj1pMvkpHijcRdfJNXj6LrLn. Estimate the income from the infection (based on current Bitcoin prices).
* The coins received within the Silk road are shown at 1F1tAaz5x1HUXrCNLbtMDqcw6o5GNn4xqX. When where the coins first gathered, and what is the total value of the coins seized (for the current value)?
* Who owns the address of 1HB5XMLmzFVj8ALj6mfBsbifRoD4miY36v? What is the total amount of funds it has received (using the current Bitcoin valuation)?
* With Ethereum, with the genesis block, what are the difficulty, the gaslimit and alloc used for?
* Cryptokitties caused a slow-down in the Ethereum network. Around the time that is was at its popularity, what was the transaction rate? [Internet research required]
* Alice tells you that Ethereum uses JavaScript to create a smart contract. You are worried that JavaScript doesn't seem to be a trustworthy language. What is required to make the code running on the blockchain trustworthy?
* Bob generates his private key and views it. Can you explain to him what the following listing defines:

## Hands-on demos

In the test, there is no need for any practical skills in setting up a Blockchain. If you are interested, though, the following provides some practical demos of using the Ethereum blockchain:
